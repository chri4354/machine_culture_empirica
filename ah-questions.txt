- Where are the networks going to be stored?
- Will all networks be pre-generated or will some networks be randomly created at runtime?
- Should the network definition include the initial/starting node?
- Should we display an error message if the user clicks on an invalid node?
- Where are the machine's solutions going to be stored?
- Will all machine solutions be pre-generated or will some machine solutions be randomly created at runtime?
- Will there be many possible machine solutions for a single network?
- Can each node be visited only once?
- Is it possible for a user to get into a "stuck" state, where they are not able to make any valid moves but the path is not complete?
