- Where are the networks going to be stored?

MongoDB Atlas

- Will all networks be pre-generated or will some networks be randomly created at runtime?

Currently: all pre-generated
Other projects: External endpoint (AWS)

- Should the network definition include the initial/starting node?

Yes, an "environment" is network + starting node

- Should we display an error message if the user clicks on an invalid node?

yes, sounds good, however should not be to intrusive

- Where are the machine's solutions going to be stored?

in the same MongoDB Atlas

- Will all machine solutions be pre-generated or will some machine solutions be randomly created at runtime?

Currently: all solutions will be pre-generated
Future: External endpoint (AWS)

- Will there be many possible machine solutions for a single network?

There will be different "settings" for the machine solution. However for each settings there will be only one solution.
Effectively solutions have to be queried by environment_id + settings.

- Can each node be visited only once?

No, there is no limit how often a node can be visited.

- Is it possible for a user to get into a "stuck" state, where they are not able to make any valid moves but the path is not complete?

Each node has two outgoing links, therefore it is not possible to get stucked.

- If the round ends before player1 finishes their solution, how will we show player1's solution to player2?

I would assume that a round which is not finished is invalid and should be redone by a different player.
